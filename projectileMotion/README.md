## Projectile Motion Predictor ##
This program allows for input of speed, angle and y displacement and predicts the landing
x displacement and time of impact into the ground.

## Compilation ##
Input the following lines into a teriminal in this directory

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

## Running the program ##
Simply run this line of code in the terminal in the build directory

	./projectileMotion

## Useful resources ##
To use this program you can go to this fun simulation website
called PHET simulations and predict where a canonball will land.

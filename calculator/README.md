## Calculator App ##
This program is a simple cli app which gets two numbers and
an operand to perform a desired operation. This is one of my first
programs created in cpp.

## Compilation ##
To compile input these commands in the calculator directory:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

Now run the binary with the command:

	./Calculator
